      	Hello! I'm Anand.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days I'm learning computer science and building
        <a href="https://www.kukkee.com/" target="_blank">Kukkee</a>.
        Previously, I worked at
        <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank">HackerRank</a> as
        a software engineer intern, where I primarily built the HackerRank Interviews for Slack
        integration, along with a bunch of features for HackerRank for Work. I was a
        <a
          href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2020/projects/5402292951449600"
          target="_blank"
          >Google Summer of Code '20</a
        >
        developer at
        <a href="https://libertem.github.io/LiberTEM" target="_blank">LiberTEM</a>,
        where I enhanced the data pipeline to allow reshaping pixelated STEM datasets and built
        a feature for handling datasets with sync/acquisition issues.
        That experience really changed the way I look at open source, which led me to start
        <a href="https://openhack.gitbook.io/openhack-20/" target="_blank"
          >FOSS OpenHack '20</a
        >
        — a program which helped 25+ students with building 10+ open source
        projects and contributing to 5+ major open source
        projects. I helped build my parents'
        <a href="https://www.telecomlead.com/" target="_blank">news sites</a>
        in WordPress and did freelance WordPress development for 5+ clients.
        During high school, I wrote articles and produced tech YouTube videos about
        gadgets at GizmoLead.
      </p>
      <p>I meditate, work out, go running with my brother and dog, love an awe-inspiring
        and sweet human, stargaze, read books and blogs, and cook okay-ish dinner while listening to music.
        I enjoy hanging out with loved ones, meeting new people
        and learning from their experiences, learning new things, exploring real-world problems,
        reading about startups, helping juniors who are still in college believe in themselves to make the best of their finite time,
        exploring our planet, watching movies, or experiencing something different.
